This ticket was primarily designed to address the review points received when Swift Code for the iOS application "Memorize" was being reviewed.
The key review point was to follow standardÂ software development practices.

Git was not implemeneted on the previous changes and as there were no version controlling present in the previous code. So, new Repo is created and the review points received in the previously are fixed in this PR. 
The previous code for which review comments were received is present in another repo https://github.com/KedarDhere/Memorize.
